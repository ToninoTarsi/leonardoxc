<p>Leonardo is a server for logging glider (paragliding at this time) flights over the internet. The flights can then be presented in a nice interface, statistics can be viewed for all the flights or a selected subset of them, and various Leagues (XC distance) are formed.</p>

<p>On its present form it is suitable for small to large gliding communities but it's design is flexible enough to cope with ever larger groups.</p>

<p>Here are some of it's features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flight analysis and scoring both open distance and OLC type</li>
<li>Each flight can be viewed and the track log can be donwloaded. In the flight analisis window the flight is shown on a map of the area. 4 graphs are also available, showing altitude over time, speed over time, vario over time and "distance from takeoff" over time especially valuable on XC flights.</li>
<li>The takeoff and landing location are calculated automatically based on a database of known points.</li>
<li>The data can be presented in a number of ways sorted by pilotName, duration, distance, olc score, takeoff Name, etc</li>
<li>There are 5 competition leagues: open distance, FAI triangle, olc scoring, flight duration, and altitude gained over takeoff.</li>
<li>There is a powerful filtering on almost all fields of the data.</li>
<li>The uploading of the flights is <em>very</em> easy : just one click</li>
<li>Multilingual (currently in 23 languages)</li>
<li>Very cool display in Google Maps and Google Earth. Cooperates with 3rd party Plugins for extra cool display in GE.</li>
<li>Connects with the 2 major global flying sites databases to link to more info about the flight's start point</li>
<li>Automatic - multiple uploads of many flights in one zip file</li>
<li>Automatic submission of XC flights to central servers that form a global XCnet</li>
<li>Works in either standalone mode or in Distributed mode acting either as a Client or Server. In Client mode it send all the local flights to the XCnetwork, in Server mode it can act as a primary node of the XCnet</li>
</ul>
